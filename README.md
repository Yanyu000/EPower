Individual Case Study of Linear Programming, Modelling and Solution at University of Edinburgh.

This case study required students to give advice to EPower company. The scenario is described in the EPower.pdf and EPowerCaseStudy.pdf files; the latter one is the siles of Lecture 14 of this course.

The report.pdf file is my solution to this case study and the modelling is in EPower.mos which should be run on Xpress with EPower.dat file.
